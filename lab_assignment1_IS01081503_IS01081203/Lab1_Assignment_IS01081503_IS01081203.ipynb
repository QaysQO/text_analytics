The card is 9.7/10, totally like new, the best condition of used EVGA FTW3 Ultra Gaming RTX 3080 in Shopee, fans and fins are clean, port plate no rust at all, only paint chips due to port screws. Great service by the seller, answered all my queries, provide all needed pictures and videos with benchmarks, unit properly safely packed, even shipped out the card the same day. Sadly, NinjaVan took 3 full days to delivered the parcel.\n",

Been survey everywhere before buying, end up buying from this super helpful guy. Its a little bit pricey if comparing from other seller out there, but i prefer to buy it from here since mostly the cheapest card out there might be use as a mining card before. Better be safe than sorry. The card is superb. Thanks bro! High recommended.\n",
