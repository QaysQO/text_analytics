araitech,2023-07-06,"Performance:will update once tested

Received card in good condition with a bit of dust here and there. Used card right so already expected.

Packaged was wrapped up nicely with bubble wrap so thick like hotel pillow. Will update performance once installed and tested."
lllkenlll,2024-02-05,"Performance:Run some bechmark working good so far.

Thia card working great. But there is some noice produced maybe from fan. I heard this is quite normal for ROG Strix RTX 3070 and above card. Overall is good.
Sorry, video shown does not have this card installed."

f*****e,2023-07-07,"Performance:Superb

Best RTX 3080 model ever. The card is 9.7/10, totally like new, the best condition of used EVGA FTW3 Ultra Gaming RTX 3080 in Shopee, fans and fins are clean, port plate no rust at all, only paint chips due to port screws. Great service by the seller, answered all my queries, provide all needed pictures and videos with benchmarks, unit properly safely packed, even shipped out the card the same day. Sadly, NinjaVan took 3 full days to delivered the parcel."
guluere,2023-06-24,"Performance:Good, at about the specified speed. You can overclock it by giving it more power.

Seller tried to prevent me from making a return. 

Seller moves you to chat on 3rd party app like WhatsApp. 

Seller tries to make you make an improper refund request to get you banned.

But the card works. And is the proper spec and model."
amirzara305,2023-03-17,"Performance:work as it should be!

If u are looking for a seller that can treat u as a friend, this is the guy. Very responsive, very helpful. And the most important is, the card look like new! Been survey everywhere before buying, end up buying from this super helpful guy. Its a little bit pricey if comparing from other seller out there, but i prefer to buy it from here since mostly the cheapest card out there might be use as a mining card before. Better be safe than sorry. The card is superb. Thanks bro! High recommended."
jkc1995,2023-05-01,Performance:Order well received. Has yet to try since I'm waiting for my mobo to arrive. But item looks to be in great condition. Good job seller.

yk0315,2023-10-16,"The product I selected is out of stock but admin is friendly and suggest me to take other brand which is similar to this gpu. 

Packaging mantap üëçüèª so far tested on few games and function well. Hopefully useful life can last longer. ü§ûüèªüòÇ 

Overall is good"
zakibinkamis,2024-03-03,"Performance:near perfect

As expected performance for an used gpu, performance wise it is very amazing, but the cleanliness is just okay, overall it is a bang for a buck"
wetdildo,2023-04-26,"Performance:tip-top

The gold standard for an online seller, was more than helpful to me when I wanted to get the ROG 3080 for myself. The GPU I received was pretty much brand new that still had the removable protective sticker on it. If you‚Äôre still having doubt on this brother, you‚Äôre overthinking. Proceed with the utmost confidence üëç
If I can give more than 5 stars I would"
rafiuddinmaidin,2023-10-27,"GPU TERPAKAI TEBAIK.. gpu temp are low even when playing AAA games with ultra setting 60¬∞c -70¬∞c with performance mode ON, no dent or dust, just like brand new gpu.. most recommend used gpu shop ever.."

zeronuu,2023-08-12,"Performance and thermals were expected of a 3070Ti. Great packaging by seller, card was cleaned before, but got a bit of thermal pad residue on the backplate when received, cleaned with my own alcohol."
fox_yhyder,2024-03-27,Item in a very good condition even though it is used..to put this gpu...i need to sacrifice 1 of my fan(*this basically my fault not seller....seller is doing their best to deliver best experience to me...thank you seller...this just me being idiot myself haha...) gpu is basically same with what i ordered...
nabiljufri,2024-03-19,"Well received package. Eventho used, the gpu actually looks good physically. Fits nicely in the case. Will update the performance when built is done."
